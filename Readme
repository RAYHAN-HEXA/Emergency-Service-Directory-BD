 1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll

 getElementById → Finds one element by its unique id.  
 getElementsByClassName → Finds all elements with the same class. Gives a collection.  
 querySelector → Finds the first element that matches a CSS selector.  
 querySelectorAll→ Finds all elements that match a CSS selector. Gives a list.  



2. How to create and insert a new element?

 Add text with innerText  or  textContent.  
 Insert it using  appendChild(), append(), or prepend().  


const div = document.createElement("div");

div.innerText = "Hello!";

document.body.appendChild(div);


3. What is Event Bubbling?

Event bubbling means an event starts from the target element and then goes up to its parents.



4. What is Event Delegation? Why useful?
Event delegation means putting one event listener on a parent, not on every child.

We check event.target to know which child was clicked.

Useful because:

Less code and better performance.

Works even for new elements added later.

5. Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()

preventDefault() → Stops default browser action (like link open or form submit).

stopPropagation() → Stops the event from going to parent elements.
